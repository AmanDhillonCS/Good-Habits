# Branching Strategy 

### Description 
---
We used **GitHub Flow** as our branching strategy.
* We made branches for every feature and once those features were implemented and tested, it was merged with the master branch.
* One member of our group was assigned to handle the merge requests.
* Due to default settings of GitLab, each branch was deleted after being sucessfully merged with the master branch.
* All the branch history can still be found in the Graph. 
* From Iteration 2 we have decided to keep the branches indefinitly after merging with the master branch.
