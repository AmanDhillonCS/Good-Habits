# Retrosprective Iteration 3
After completion of iteration 2 we reassessed our work as we faced some major problems in completing tasks. We focused on testing in iteration 3 as well as aimed to complete required features.

**What went well?**
* Initial planning was good.

**What went poorly**?
* Work distribution was still a bit off with too much work assigned to a single person.

**What major actions took place in iteration 3?**
* Work was divided more evenly.   
* 3 types testing was divided among 3 members.
* We refactored code that was pointed out in iteration 2 earlier in iteration 3.
* We did achieve what we ultimatly planned for iteration 3 that major features were completed and test  

**pushed features**  
* These two feature we pushed as they had medium to low priority and didn't change much of the project.

**How can we improve in future iteration?**
* Similar approach of work distribution among members.
* Good planning before implementation.

# Retrosprective Iteration 2
After completion of iteration 1 we had planned to move what had worked from iteration 1 to iteration 2.  

**What went well?**
* Regular meetings went well.
* Communication was good.

**What went poorly**?
* Work distribution was bit off with too much work assigned to a single person.
* Too much time spent on fixing persistence storage.

**What major actions took place in iteration 2?**
* Irresolvable bug in implementation of HSQLDB took most of our iteration 2 time. To resolve this we switched to using SQLite as our persistence storage database. As a result of this issue we also ended up pushing few features from iteration 2 to iteration 3.   
* We were still able to implement [Delete habit](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/3350-winter-2021-a02/group-12/good-habits-a02-12/-/issues/5) and [Detailed view](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/3350-winter-2021-a02/group-12/good-habits-a02-12/-/issues/4)  
* We planned to do code refactoring and Iteration 1 code fix to end of the iteraion 2.

**How can we improve in itertion 3?**
* We plan to improve in iteration 3 by having more equal work distribution i.e. dividing work evenly among all members of the group. Big features like implementation of database should have been distributed two or more members instead of one. 
* We will aim to plan more throughly before actual implementation. 
* Due to lack of time we were not able to do code refactoring and fixes. From next iteration we plan to do previous iterations fixes first before adding new features.
