              <p>Good Habits is a habit-tracking application that can be used to develop good habits or get rid of bad habits.The main goal of Good Habits is to make an individual complete the tasks they have created. Each task in this context is a habit that a user wants to start or quit. The application will send out notifications at certain time intervals to keep the users on track. The app will also contain a detailed description of ongoing and past activities or habits a user has performed. To keep the peorson motivated and focused the user will receive motivational quotes at the homescreen.
                   Moreover, it will give users a rating on how they are doing towards a habit so they get a sense of achievement and flaunt it among friends.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column Audience"><h1><strong>Intended Audience</strong></h1>
                <p>According to Healthline, it takes a person on average about 66 days to develop a regular habit so it is made for people who have trouble developing new habits in a consistent manner, which mostly includes young adults. Furthermore, Good Habit is intended for people who lack a feeling of motivation and achievement and want something to push them towards their goals.</p>

                 <h3>Amandeep Dhillon</h3>
                     <p>Building this application helped me understand the process of software development. It also helped me 
                     understand why documentation and planning is important in software development cycle. Developing in a group improved my communication and time management skills. I learned new concepts of intergation testing and system testing.

                    <h3>Proyash Saha</h3>
                        <p>Developing this application gave me a better understanding of the three-tier architecture and how it can benefit developers that want to maintain the project in the future. Also, I learned Test-driven development and how it helps us complete a project faster and with fewer bugs.
                             Lastly, the use of Gitlab to maintain the project’s development lifecycle gave me a taste of how different versions of an application are worked on simultaneously and released when one is ready.

                        <p>Developing this application was a major achievement for me. The experience of my own application showed me vast opportunities in software engineering and proper practices for careers in computer science. I also learned about the use of different designs and architectures which are used by modern applications.

                        <p>Developing this application has deepened my understanding of programming. I learned the importance of planning for a long-term project. In terms of coding, I learned about SOLID principles and the importance of building a sound architecture. Besides that methods of integration test and system test developed my knowledge with more comprehensive approaches to test code.

            <h3><strong>Postmortem</strong></h3>
            <div class="posttxt">
                <h3>What went right in the development process?</h3>
                <p>The development process had many positive points. One of them was regular meetings and discussions, which helped in getting small tasks done faster.
                    Regular meetings also helped in better work distribution and helped in revealing each developer's skills. Each and every group member learned something new throughout this process which will help them for their future developing endeavours.
                </p> 

                <h3>What went wrong during the development process?</h3>
                <p>One particular big hurdle we faced was getting the database working for the persistent layer of the application. This lead to some features being push to future iterations and incomplete testing.
                </p>
                <p>Another problem we faced was not being able to understand how time to allot for a particular task. This lead to some iterations with large amount of work while others had very little work involved.
                </p>

                <h3>What took the most time?</h3>
                <p>Database implementation took the most time. We were not able to resolve a bug related HSQLDB which lead to switching to SQLite database. At the begining of iteration 2, we didn't expect the database to take most of the iteration 2 time and decided to assign it to a single person. This decision lead to major changes such as delay in implementation of new features 
                    and minimal testing of new features. One lesson we learned from this mistake was to assign multiple people to big tasks in iteration 3 which worked well in completing tasks.
                </p>

                <h3>How did the project change?</h3>
                <p>In iteration 0 we initially planned the project for five people but with one person dropping we still managed to complete major functionalities of the app and no major changes were made to the app. Major features like adding/deleting a habit were still implemented. Features with low and medium priority like Dark mode and Daily task schedule were dropped for future iteraion.
